@name This will be your private space for discussing with the mentors, for any question you have pertaining to your game and situation. 
you can always ask general knowledge related questions here but I'd advise to do so in the question and strategy question feed. so that all the other players may learn about it too
please don't forget to check the pins for the rest of the channels and remember you can pin things in this channel if you want to save them. ðŸ™‚

For making it easy for mentors to assist you, please consider providing  some information for the mentors. 

1). Post a Screenshot of your Pretender God/Bless/Build. 

2). Provide what your current research is. (make sure to update this overtime) 

3). Provide your current gem income, item stash, and gem stockpile.

4). Take pictures of the troops and mages you have available.

5). Save and post information about opponents in your game
